- https://tunebat.com/Analyzer - getting the key of a song (these likely won't be accurate all the time, but then again as long no one notices it's fine. if a song has a pro vocal or real instrument chart it's probably better to guess based on those...)
- \[literally any DAW\] - Tempo/BPM (just put the song's chart into REAPER or something, if it changes, is variable, just use the starting BPM or round it up)
- i've personally been making the song previews by importing the stems into fl studio and re-exporting them to MP3, but you could probably do it in anything else; user preference
